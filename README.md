## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Mouadh Saadaoui from Tunisia, and i am currently a student at ESPRIT (Ã‰cole SupÃ©rieure PrivÃ©e d'IngÃ©nierie et de Technologie), specializing in IT Architecture and Cloud Computing, with a strong focus on DevOps. I am gaining hands-on experience with leading cloud platforms like AWS and Google Cloud, and I am actively learning and working with various DevOps tools including Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform. My education and practical experience in software engineering have provided me with a solid foundation in programming, virtualization, and application architecture.
